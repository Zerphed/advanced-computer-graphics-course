Personal work for the course Advanced Course in Computer Graphics. 

This repository contains course works from two different iterations of the course. In year 2012 the course consisted of project works done in OpenGL 3.3. In year 2013 the course consisted of invidual assignments done in a specific provided framework. The assignments varied from instant radiosity solvers to path tracing. In both years the programming was done in C++.
