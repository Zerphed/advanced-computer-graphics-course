Assignment: Assignment 4

1. COLLABORATION:
-----------------

As always, I had some collaboration with Paula Jukarainen, debugging the code and figuring out the general idea.

2. REFERENCES:
--------------

Below are listed the few web resources I used while programming my path tracer implementation.

3. KNOWN PROBLEMS:
------------------

As far as I know there are no _real_ known problems with the solution. The regular sampling however produces funny results, but that is to be expected. Another small issue is a thin black line at the center of the table in the conference scene, but I would blame that more on the scene files than my path tracer implementation.


4. EXTRA CREDIT:
-------------------

I didn't implement any of the extra credit that was listed but I did implement a couple of useful sampling methods, namely: halton, stratified and plain random sampling. I also tried to improve my SAH implementation.

I also implemented my own test scene to test the russian roulette. This can be found under the scenes folder.


5. ARTIFACTS:
--------------------

The required renderings of the 3 scenes can be found under the captured_scenes folder. The scenes were rendered using the halton sequence option (not default).


6. COMMENTS:
---------------------

This was great! It's a shame I didn't have more time to implement all the cool extra credit that you had planned, but I guess I can continue my studies outside the class as well. Thanks! :)

My sincere thanks for the extra time.
