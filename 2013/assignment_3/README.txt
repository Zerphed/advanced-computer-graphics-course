Assignment: Assignment 3

1. COLLABORATION:
-----------------

As always, I had some collaboration with Paula Jukarainen, mainly getting help from her explaining the general idea behind the instant radiosity.


2. REFERENCES:
--------------

This time there were no real references that I used. I did need some help with the GLSL stuff from the OpenGL GLSL API though.

3. KNOWN PROBLEMS:
------------------

There are no known problems with the code. Just remember if you run the sample solution you need to delete the hierarchies before running my solution, as the code will try to load the hierarchies and crash, since the load- and saveHierarchy functions haven't been implemented.

There is one small issue, but I don't think it's due to my code. Upon loading the Cornell scene parameters seem to differ from those of the sample solution. This results in a darker image, but the image gets corrected if the parameters are set to the same values.


4. EXTRA CREDIT:
-------------------

No extra credit this time, sorry folks, had enough trouble debugging the code as it is.


5. ARTIFACTS:
--------------------

No artifacts were required for this exercise.


6. COMMENTS:
---------------------

I ran into quite a few problems this round, from which the lack of time around Wappu wasn't the smallest.

Codewise I had trouble running the example solution on my computer due to the Intel HD4000 graphics card. It also took quite a bit of time to figure out how to fix the problem in my solution so that I could develop the code at all.

My sincere thanks for the extra time.
